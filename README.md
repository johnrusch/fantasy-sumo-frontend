# Fantasy Sumo - Frontend

Fantasy Sumo is a fantasy sports app for fans of Sumo Wrestling. Users can create leagues with other users, draft teams of sumo wrestlers, and compete for the most points.

[This](https://github.com/johnrusch/fantasy-sumo-backend) is a link to the back-end repository.

## Motivation

After playing "Fantasy Sumo" with friends only using an excel spreadsheet, I wanted to create an app that makes the experience automatic and user friendly.
