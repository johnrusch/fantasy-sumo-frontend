      <h6>Here are some rules and info about Fantasy Sumo</h6>
      <p>Each league will draft rikishi in an order
      determined by the individual league. We recommend drafting approximately
      35 rikishi in each league, leaving a bench of 7 or so to choose from in
      the event of injuries or other withdrawals. Leagues with 4 participants
      should draft 9 rikishi each, for example, or leagues with 8 participants
      should draft 4 rikishi each. Points: 1 point per victory No points for
      victories against rikishi wrestling in the Juryo (lower) division. Bonus
      points can be earned by defeating sanyaku. If a maegashira defeats a
      sekiwake, for example, 2 bonus points will be awarded, for a total of
      three points. A komusubi defeating a yokozuna will earn 3 bonus points, or
      4 total points. 5 bonus points for Yusho 5 bonus points for special prizes
      Injured rikishi may be replaced from the pool of undrafted rikishi. Points
      will only be awarded if the new pick is reported to the league manager
      before the day's points are calculated, to prevent cheating, obviously.
      Buy-in / prize money is determined by each league. If you don't pay the
      buy-in before the next draft, you're kicked out of Fantasy Sumo forever.
      Here are some terms to know: Rikishi - wrestler Dohyo - wrestling ring,
      made of clay Basho - sumo tournament Makuuchi - sumo's top division
      Maegashira - rank & file wrestler Sanyaku - literally "the three ranks"
      (there are four of them), split into two groups - yokozuna & ozeki, and
      sekiwake & komusubi Yokozuna - highest rank in sumo, also the public face
      of sumo wrestling Ozeki - second highest rank, or "champion" rank Sekiwake
      - third highest rank Komusubi - fourth highest rank, literally "the little
      knot" Kinboshi - a maegashira's victory over a Yokozuna, sometimes called
      a "gold star" victory Yusho - tournament victory Sansho - special prizes
      awarded at the end of the tournament to exceptional rikishi. There are
      three of them: gino-sho, kanto-sho, and shukun-sho. Kachi-koshi - when a
      rikishi wins more bouts in a tournament than he loses Kimarite - winning
      techniques a rikishi can use to win a match. Currently the Japanese Sumo
      Association recognizes 82 different kimarite. Mawashi - belt that rikishi
      wear during a bout Tachiai - initial charge at the beginning of the match
      Gyoji - referee â€‹Good luck!</p>
